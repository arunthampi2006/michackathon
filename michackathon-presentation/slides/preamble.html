                Similar to customer experience personalization provided by e-commerce sites (say Amazon), emirates.com can potentially build a similar platform (standalone recommendation engine).
            </li>
            <li class="fragment">
                This platform will mine the customer data by either using HELIX or through Boxeverâ€™s existing customer identification methodologies to find their travel history and recommend travel plans e.g. business traveler frequently travelling from DXB-BOM-DXB.
            </li>
            <li class="fragment">
                While recommending the travel plans, the engine would look at the price for the day (say DXB-BOM on 12th November in emirates.com is 1000 AED) and offer a spot discount to make the sale more lucrative. This can be based on rating engine which can be configured to not offer more than 10% discount at any given time.
            </li>
            <li class="fragment">
                This will potentially open a lot of cross-sell and up-sell opportunities and help bundle different offerings to provide maximum customer value.
