## Solution principles

Solution will be developed using Microservices architecture principles.

* Hexagonal architecture
* Domain driven design – focus on specific functional domain. Technology neutral
* Hide implementation details – through containerization and REST/HTTP calls between services
* Decentralization – package and deploy all the necessary components of a service as one logical unit. Scale independently
* Failure isolation – one malfunctioning service does not adversely impact the whole application
* Continuous delivery through DevOps culture
